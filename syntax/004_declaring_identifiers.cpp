/* All C++ variables must be identified with unique names.
These unique names are called identifiers.
Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume). */
// Good
//int minutesPerHour = 60;

// OK, but not so easy to understand what m actually is
//int m = 60;
//

/* Names can contain letters, digits and underscores
Names must begin with a letter or an underscore (_)
Names are case-sensitive (myVar and myvar are different variables)
Names cannot contain whitespaces or special characters like !, #, %, etc.
Reserved words (like C++ keywords, such as int) cannot be used as names */
